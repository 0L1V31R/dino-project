# Dio Dino Game Project

Online class made by [DIO](https://web.digitalinnovation.one), where he was taught how to create a dinosaur game using html, css and JS.

What I used: VsCode

The game can be run directly in the browser (index.html) and the dinosaur jumps using the spacebar on the computer keyboard.
